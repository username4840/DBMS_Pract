Aim:- Design atleast 10 queries for suitable databse application using SQL,DML,statements insert,select,update,delete with operator,function and set operator.

CREATE DATABASE DML;
USE DML;

//Create Table: library
CREATE TABLE library (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    purpose VARCHAR(30),
    class VARCHAR(10),
    bookname VARCHAR(20)
);

//Insert Records
INSERT INTO library (id, name, purpose, class, bookname) VALUES
(1, 'Gauri', 'books', 'BE', 'C++'),
(2, 'Pooja', 'internet', 'TE', 'Java'),
(3, 'Nilam', 'reading', 'TE', NULL),
(4, 'Ram', 'internet', 'FE', 'C'),
(5, 'Sham', 'bookreturn', 'TE', 'Python'),
(6, 'Sita', 'self-learning', 'TE', 'TOC'),
(7, 'Yashodha', 'reading', 'BE', 'Shakespeare');

//SELECT All Records
SELECT * FROM library;

//UPDATE Records
UPDATE library SET class = 'SE' WHERE id = 3;
UPDATE library SET bookname = 'C++' WHERE id = 1;

//DELETE Record
DELETE FROM library WHERE id = 7;

//WHERE Clause
SELECT * FROM library WHERE id < 4;
SELECT * FROM library WHERE id IN (1, 3, 5);

//DISTINCT & ORDER BY
SELECT DISTINCT(class) FROM library;
SELECT * FROM library ORDER BY name ASC;

//BETWEEN Operator
SELECT * FROM library WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 4;
SELECT * FROM library WHERE id NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 4;

//Aggregate Functions
SELECT MIN(id) AS Min_ID FROM library;
SELECT SUM(id) AS Total_ID FROM library;
SELECT COUNT(bookname) AS Books_Count FROM library;

//Create Another Table: college
CREATE TABLE college (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    class VARCHAR(10),
    division VARCHAR(5)
);

INSERT INTO college (id, name, class, division) VALUES
(5, 'Utkarsha', 'FE', 'A'),
(6, 'Rutuja', 'SE', 'A'),
(7, 'Shreya', 'BE', 'B');

// Set Operators (UNION / UNION ALL)
-- Unique class list (no duplicates)
SELECT class FROM college
UNION
SELECT class FROM library;

-- All class entries (including duplicates)
SELECT class FROM college
UNION ALL
SELECT class FROM library;

-- Combine student names from both tables
SELECT name FROM college
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM library;


//Additional Examples of Operators
-- Use LIKE operator
SELECT * FROM library WHERE purpose LIKE '%read%';

-- Use IS NULL
SELECT * FROM library WHERE bookname IS NULL;

-- Use logical operator
SELECT * FROM library WHERE class='TE' AND bookname='Java';


//Final Output Check
Copy code
SELECT * FROM library;
SELECT * FROM college;
